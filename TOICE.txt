1. Input request :

Text : We need to build an AI-powered PRD extraction system that takes raw dump inputs (PDF, DOCX, emails, meeting notes, scanned text, etc.) and automatically extracts structured PRD content including product overview, objectives, scope, features, functional requirements, non-functional requirements, timelines, milestones, risks, and dependencies; the project should start on 15 March 2026 with MVP expected by 30 May 2026 and final release by 30 July 2026; team allocation will be: 1 Project Manager (20% allocation, oversees delivery and stakeholder sync), 2 Backend Engineers (100% allocation for API + parsing engine), 1 NLP Engineer (100% allocation for model fine-tuning and prompt optimization), 1 Frontend Developer (75% allocation for dashboard UI), 1 QA Engineer (50% allocation from sprint 2 onward), and 1 DevOps Engineer (30% allocation for CI/CD and deployment setup); core requirements include accepting multiple file formats, handling noisy and unstructured text, identifying PRD sections even when headings are missing, generating structured JSON output, confidence scoring for extracted sections, user review/edit interface, versioning of extracted documents, and export in PDF/Doc/JSON formats; non-functional requirements include processing time under 30 seconds per 20-page document, 95% section classification accuracy, role-based access control, audit logs, and secure cloud deployment (AWS preferred); risks include inconsistent input formatting, OCR errors, ambiguous requirements language, and scalability bottlenecks; dependencies include OpenAI API (or equivalent LLM), OCR engine integration, cloud storage (S3), and authentication service; success metrics include reducing manual PRD structuring time by 70%, achieving at least 85% user approval rate on extracted structure, and supporting at least 500 documents per day by phase 2.
